Don't know what to listen to? Find out what's popular in countries that you'd most like to travel to using MapJamz!

MapJamz is music discovery app to search weekly top tracks by country. The background dynamically changes as searches are made, and returned tracks can be streamed in-app.

## Usage

## About MapJamz

This project was completed in my 6th week at Dev Bootcamp, and was built using Ruby, Sinatra, JavaScript (jQuery and AJAX). I used the Last.fm, Google Maps, and YouTube APIs.

A special thanks goes out to all Bobolinks, Coyotes, and Wolves of SF 2016, as well as DBC teachers and mentors! - In particular, for Alex Carroll, for providing me with the name of this application.
